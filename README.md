# Four Digital To Do List

[Our to do list](https://fac-12.github.io/JJJH-ToDoList/)

## Why?

We were given the challenge of creating a to do list. We wanted to build on last week's work by making it accessible  and responsive, as well as following this week's task to build it using TDD.

## What?
We wanted our to do list to have the following functionality:
* the user is able to add items to the to do list
* the user is able to mark an item as complete
* the user is able to edit the description text
* the user is able to sort items by whether the item is marked as complete
* the user is able to sort items by date entered
* the user is able delete items

We wanted it to have a simple design.

## How?

### Planning our work

This week's project was fairly structured and already split into parts, so we only spent a small amount of time in planning.

On Wednesday we started with the pure Javascript functions, splitting the work between the two pairs. We followed TDD, writing failing tests first and then writing code to make them pass. After lunch we moved onto the DOM.

Thursday was spent with one team working on CSS and the other adding the sorting functionality as well as by making the description on each to do item editable.

### Stretch Goals
We wanted to include two sorting functions, one which sorts by whether the items are complete, and one which sorts by the date (for which we used ID as a proxy as the items were always input in order). These two options were presented as a select element.
